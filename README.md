#### The frontend uses the following project file structure (The main project file structure is in the backend docs):

(New File Structure will be added here)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:33324](http://localhost:33324) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `docker run -d -p 0.0.0.0:33324:33324 <image name>`

First you're gonna have to build the docker image, and give it a name..

If you face any issues regarding running the docker container, try running the container using Docker Desktop with this configuration
